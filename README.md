# Rejected-Paystub-w2-audit-SQL-Looker-Data-analysis-Data-cleaning-Google-sheets
To analyze major reasons behind the document rejection of borrowers by the respective team.
In this project I identified the exact reason the paystub was rejected. Documented all actions taken to rectify the rejected paystub. This included:
Adjusting hours in the system
Re-calculating deductions
Re-generating the paystub
Communicating with the borrowers to resolve the issue
Added all relevant notes or observations about the situation. This included details about the communication with the employee, or any challenges encountered. 
By following this structured approach, I ensurde that all paystub rejections are properly documented, facilitating efficient payroll processing and accurate record-keeping.
